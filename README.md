# AI-Driven Multi-Criteria GIS Analysis for Site Selection
### Case Study: Hatia Municipality, Bangladesh

## Project Overview
This project integrates **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** with **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** to identify optimal locations for Fecal Sludge Treatment Plants (FSTP). By combining spatial data with decision logic, this tool aims to provide evidence-based siting solutions for urban planners.

## Key Features
* **Multi-Criteria Analysis:** Weights various factors including distance from water bodies, road accessibility, and population density.
* **GIS Integration:** Visualizes suitability maps for the Hatia Municipality.
* **Data-Driven:** Reduces subjectivity in infrastructure planning.

## Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python (Pandas for data handling)
* **Methodology:** Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for weight distribution.

## Future Scope (AI Integration)
To further automate this process, I am exploring the use of Machine Learning to predict future land-use changes and refine the suitability weights dynamically.
